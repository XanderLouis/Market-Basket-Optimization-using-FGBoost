    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "We've been hired to boost sales and optimize the marketing strategies of this food store using a technique called market basket optimization. The goal is to identify patterns in customer purchases to create effective product bundles and offers that will encourage customers to buy more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario:\n",
    "It is the south of France, locals frequently visit their favorite shops. The business owner wants you to herlp leverage the purchasing habits of your customers to offer compelling deals. By understanding the associations between different products, create offers like \"buy this, get that\" to increase sales and customer satisfaction."

    "We'll use the FP-Growth algorithm, a popular method for finding associations between items in large datasets. It helps us identify combinations of products that frequently appear together and measure the strength of these associations using metrics like support, confidence, and lift."
